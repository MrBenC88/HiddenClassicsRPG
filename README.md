# Hidden Classics Pavilion RPG

## A text-based RPG (Role-playing Game)

**Project Overview:**
*Hidden Classics Pavilion*, is a simple role-playing game with adventure elements. 
The basic mechanics of the game involves the navigation of a player through a map with the goal of collecting a variety of remnant texts.
Obstacles are in the way blocking the user's end goal as the user will have to deal with challengers along their journey. 
Once the user collects all the texts, the user learns the truth of the world.


**Application Usage:**
- The application will allow a user to explore a storyline with relative freedom in the selection of options.
- The application is at first text-based which will then (hopefully) be converted to a 3D overhead and open-world style movement for the player.
- It is meant to allow users to enjoy and experience an role play adventure.
- It will allow the user to interact with their character stats, inventory, and other characters.
- Users will have to cope with challengers along the way which involve a battle sequence.
- Users will be able to learn the truth of functional programming.

**Target User(s):**
- Idle individuals
- RPG enthusiasts 
- The handsome TA marking this

**Why this project:**
This project was chosen because of the interest in creating a functional RPG using object oriented programming. The goal is to surpass a simple text-based project with more interesting and involved mechanics for the end user.
